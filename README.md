# Simple Meal

Simple Meal is a web app that helps people to simplify their meal planning and grocery shopping ritual. The idea was to create a very easy-to-use app that will provide recipes depending on what ingredients the user wants to eat or buy.

Yes, the goal is to simplify grocery shopping but also is to reduce food waste. Using the same ingredients in different meals during the week should help to use the majority of the product before it expires, HENCE, save money.
